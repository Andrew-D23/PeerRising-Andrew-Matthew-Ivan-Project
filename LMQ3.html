   <p>According to TB Alert, the UV light in natural light could help reduce the amount of TB bacteria. Maintaining good hygiene like making sure to cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze reduces the chance of it spreading to other people or other surfaces. Without filtered air being brought into the room regularly, TB bacteria could infect more people as it is not removed. Also making sure to wear a mask when you are in public or when you are near people could reduce the spread.</p>
