   <h2>Information</h2>
   <p>According to the CDC, maintaining good oral habits and brushing your teeth with fluoride toothpaste routinely, such as twice a day, will significantly improve your oral health, as will not using any tobacco products such as cigarettes or chewing tobacco, which can damage your teeth. By chewing sugarless gum you can also reduce the amount of sugar you intake, thus reducing the possible cavities. Going to dental check ups regularly and if you have unusual symptoms such as a painful toothache will also prevent serious issues from slipping by, ensuring that you can receive treatment for them before itâ€™s too late. Also keep in mind that you cannot fix cavities past a certain point; prevention is the best medicine.</p>
   <p>According to the WHO, almost half of the worlds population (~3.5 billion people or ~44% of the global population) suffer from oral diseases such as tooth decay, severe gum disease, tooth loss, and oral cancer as of 2022. Severe gum disease is a major cause of total tooth loss and is estimated to affect 1 billion people alone.</p>
   <p>The correct answer is roughly 44%.</p>
