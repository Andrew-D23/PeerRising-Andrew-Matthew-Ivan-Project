   <h2>Information</h2>
   <p>There is currently no instant cure for measles itself; it must be fought off by the body itself over the course of 10-14 days. However, there are some medicines to reduce symptoms such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for aches, pains, and fever, and vaccines that are nearly guaranteed to prevent measles for most people. Getting enough rest and drinking plenty of fluids can also help you feel better. Waiting four days after you get the rash to return to work or school will help reduce contagion and spread.</p>
   <p>Measles is a very contagious airborne viral disease. About 288,000 people catch measles per year with roughly 134,200 dead. Despite this, it is very easily preventable through vaccines. Symptoms of measles include fever, dry coughing, a runny nose, a sore throat, inflamed eyes, and a skin rash made from large, flat blotches that flow into each other. It is usually not very serious, but for some people it may be more severe or even lethal, causing symptoms from diarrhea to a middle ear infection to even pneumonia and encephalitis (a serious brain infection).</p>
   <p>The correct answer is Vaccination.</p>
