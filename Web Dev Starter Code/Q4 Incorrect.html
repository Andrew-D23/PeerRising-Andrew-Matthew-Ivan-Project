   <p>Measles is a very contagious airborne viral disease. About 288,000 people catch measles per year with roughly 134,200 dead. Despite this, it is very easily preventable through vaccines. Symptoms of measles include fever, dry coughing, a runny nose, a sore throat, inflamed eyes, and a skin rash made from large, flat blotches that flow into each other. It is usually not very serious, but for some people it may be more severe or even lethal, causing symptoms from diarrhea to a middle ear infection to even pneumonia and encephalitis (a serious brain infection).</p>
