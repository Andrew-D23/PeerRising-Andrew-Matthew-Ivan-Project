   <h2>Information</h2>
   <p>Movement, exercise, or many other forms of physical activity are great ways to help relieve some of the strain that leading a sedentary lifestyle may put on your body. Engaging in physical activity releases endorphins, strengthens the connection that we have with our bodies, and allows us to take a break from everyday challenges and responsibilities while also helping to prevent or control the risks of a sedentary lifestyle. However, your relationship may be potentially harmful if it does not allow for rest or sick days, must meet certain requirements to count, or feels like something you have to do.</p>
   <p>According to the WHO (World Health Organization), about 2 million deaths per year were linked to physical inactivity as of 2002, making it one of the top 10 leading causes of death and disability in the world. Sedentary lifestyles increase all causes of mortality, double the risk of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity, and increase the risks physical illnesses like colon cancer, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and lipid disorders, as well as mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. 60 to 85% of people in the world lead sedentary lifestyles, making it one of the more serious yet insufficiently addressed public health problems of our time.</p>
   <p>The correct answer is roughly 2 Million.</p>
